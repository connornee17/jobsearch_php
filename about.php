			<li>The current version of PHP installed on mercury is: <?php  echo phpversion(); ?></li>
			<li>I have attempted all tasks in the Assignment to completion.</li>
			<li>There are no special features outside of what is required in the Assignment. However, I did want to use more CSS to make the website cleaner but ran out of time so I settled for more basic styles to make the pages look good enough. Some of the things I wanted to be nicer was the footer, and the layout of the forms themselves (even though they are all completely functional).</li>
			<li>I did not participate in any of the discussions on the swinburne discussion board, simply because i did not have anything I needed answered by other studetns, nor did I believe I had anything to contribute to the current discussions that already existed on the board.</li>
